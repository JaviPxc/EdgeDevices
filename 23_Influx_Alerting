# Creating an Alert Management

Open up the tab "ALERTING" -> "Manage Tasks" in InfluxDB. <br>
Create a new alert rule by clicking the button "+ Build Alert Rule"
Define, what variable should create an alert once it reaches an defined value. <br> To do so, define the variable under "Time Series" and define the alert condition under "Conditions". <br>

Next, we need to define a handler to the alert. You have a huge variaty on what should happen once the alert is active, for example send an e-mail via SMTP. <br>

You can also integrate your alerts into your dashboard-visualisation to display, at what time an alert accures. <br>
The alerts can be find in the "EXPLORE" tab in the "chronograf.autogen" database. <br> Next, choose which alert should be visualised and define the "level" to "CRITICAL" so the alert will be displayed. You can then implement the diagram by clicking the button "Send to Dashboard" in the upper-right corner to implement it to your dashbaord.
