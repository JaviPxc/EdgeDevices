## What is new with FW 2023.0 LTS ?!
<br>

With Firmware 2023.0 LTS, the Edge Devices EPC 1502 and EPC 1522  are greatly improved in their performance.
PLCnext 2023.0 LTS combined with the PLCnext Engineer 2023.3 LTS bring great improvements for control tasks (IEC 61131).

Another great focus is the improvements of the interfaces and the user interface "Web Based Management".

### Flexible in the use of OpenSource
If you have updated your EPC from FW 2022, the OpenSource Software Node-RED and InfluxDB are now to be found inside the tab "Apps" inside the Web Based Management. The Apps can now be deleted and therefore updated very easily. <br>
If you have purchased a new EPC running FW 2023.0 LTS, you can still implement Node-RED and InfluxDB very easily via our PLCnext Store. <br> - With the great benefit of choosing which version you would like to implement!

### Everything immediately in sight!
The new Cockpit (default 192.168.1.10/wbm) immediately gives all information such as utilization of CPU, memory capacities for local data immediately perceived at a glance. <br>

### Cost-effective HMI solution!
The local DisplayPort can now be configured to output any Visualisation to create a easy and cost-efficient visualisation solution. <br>

### Ready to use for as many Apps as you want!
Firmware 2023.0 LTS comes with many improvements for implementing Docker Containers. <br>  
Node-RED and InfluxDB no longer comes pre-installed with your EPC. <br> Since it is that easy to install those software from the PLCnext Store, you are now more flexible in choosing the version that you require. <br>
If you already have a running projekt with Node-RED or InfluxDB, those are kept after the update! <br>
