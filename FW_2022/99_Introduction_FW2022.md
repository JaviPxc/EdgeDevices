## What is Edge Computing?
An Edge PC processes data closer to where it is generated, instead of processing it in the Cloud - with great benefits in Latency, bandwith of your network and secruity!

>Edge Computing is the practice of capturing, storing, processing and analyzing data near the client, where the data is generated. <br>

The EPC combines the functionality of a traditional PLC (programable via PLCnext Engineer) with all featured protocals like Profinet, OPC UA, Modbus,... <br>
and the functionality of an IoT device. <BR>
Software like Node-RED or Influx-DB are pre-installed with easy integration.
With Docker-Portainer unlimited use-cases can be served. <br>

With interfaces that are completely new to the PLCnext Technology for a complete Edge solution: <br>
- Displayport to output a local visualisation or configure the device without any Host-PC connected.
- WLAN to connect wirelessly to the internet for a complete Cloud solution.
