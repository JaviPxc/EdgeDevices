> USB ports are enabled by default and can be disabled with this setting. If the USB ports will not be used, it is recommended to disable the USB ports for additional security.

The USB ports can be enabled or disabled inside the Web-Based-Management (WBM).
Inside the WBM, go to "Edge" and "Settings". <br>
A restart is required if you changed the settings. <br>
