The Edge PC repository is a collection of various sample code for Node-RED for Edge PC:

1185416 â€“ EPC 1502 

1185423 -  EPC 1522 

Each example explains one or more topics on how to use Nodes and Function in the pre-installed Node-RED.

## Getting Started

1. Connect the power-supply to your EPC
2. Connect your Host-PC to X2-LAN, open up your cockpit during the first start-up using the URL: "192.168.2.10/cockpit"
3. Configure your network. Profinet can only be used with X3-LAN interface.
   The IP-address can be changed in the "Extended Configuration" tab inside your cockpit.
4. See the chapter below to create your IoT usecase!

## Edge-Cockpit
To start any function on the EPC, make sure your Host-PC is connected via Ethernet and configured in the same network.
Open up a webbrowser (e.g. Google Chrome) and open-up the Edge-Cockpit:
<b>ip-adress/cockpit </b>
(default X2-Ip adress: 192.168.2.10/cockpit) <br>
